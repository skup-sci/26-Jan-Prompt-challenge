# 🌾 Multilingual Mandi – AI Saathi for Bharat

Multilingual Mandi is a **voice-first, farmer-friendly Generative AI platform** designed to empower India’s local markets by enabling **fair price discovery and simple negotiation across languages**.

The platform is built using **Kiro** as part of the *Multilingual Mandi / AI for Bharat* challenge and focuses on **inclusion, simplicity, and real-world usability for Indian farmers and small vendors**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Indian farmers and local vendors often face:
- Language barriers during trade
- Lack of transparency in mandi prices
- Digital tools that assume literacy and English proficiency
- Dependence on middlemen due to information asymmetry

Most existing platforms are **text-heavy, complex, and not designed for rural users**.

---

## 💡 Solution

Multilingual Mandi reimagines AI as a **trusted digital saathi**, not a complex system.

The platform allows users to:
- Speak naturally in their local language
- Instantly know whether a price is fair
- Get polite AI-assisted negotiation suggestions
- Use the app **without reading, typing, or logging in**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- Farmer-first, not tech-first  
- Voice over text  
- One primary action: **Speak**  
- Large buttons, icons over text  
- Calm, familiar green (hariyali) visual language  
- Works even for users with low digital literacy  

If a user cannot read, the app should still work perfectly.
